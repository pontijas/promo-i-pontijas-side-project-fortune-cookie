Hello!

My name is Cristina Pontijas and I am a pupil of Idelisa promotion in Adalab. I am very happy to show you my first personal project.

This project simulates the fortune cookies you get in chinese restaurants, so when you click on the fortune cookie it handles you a lucky advice.
To create the app I used quotes of ancient chinese philosophy.

I also used:
-HTML5.
-CSS3.
-Sass.
-Javascript.
-Gulp.
-Git.
-Github.
-Github Pages.
-Responsive web design.

Thank you for reading and enjoy the app!
